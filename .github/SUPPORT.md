# Support

If you have questions about CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) usage, please feel free to create a topic on [the official community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core/cdk-for-terraform/).

## Enterprise/Commercial Support

If you are an existing Terraform Enterprise or Terraform Cloud for Business customer, please submit a HashiCorp support request or email tf-cloud@hashicorp.support

Please note that while the CDKTF AWS Adapter is in technical preview, it is not eligible for full commercial support. However, you may still submit support tickets, and our team will try to address them on a best-effort basis.
